      <h2>Buntod Reef, The Place You'll Love To Be</h2>
      <p>Buntod Reef, so bright and clear, The ocean whispers, soft and near. With fish that dance and corals glow, its nature's magic down below.</p>
      <p>I love the breeze, the skies so blue, The mangroves strong, the waters true. Each wave that splashes on the sand, Feels like a hug from nature's hand.</p>
      <p>It's calm, it's pureâ€”so full of life, A break from noise,from stress and strife. Buntod's beauty speaks to me, A home of hope beneath the sea.</p>

      <h2>Takanashi Hoshino</h2>
      <!-- (long poem content kept the same as yours) -->
      <p>
        The student from abydos,
        The vice president of the student council
        The president of the countermeasures committee
        The one said and feared to be the strongest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takanashi Hoshino, a koala in her school,
        Always sleepy, but never a fool.
        She smiles as if the world is light,
        But inside, she's tired from every fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wasn't always calm and slow,
        Her wrath once even made anger bow.
        She worked the hardest, gave her all,
        Until her senior took the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kunichinashi Yume, the one who had led,
        With carefree smiles and jokes she said.
        But hoshino stood to guard her side,
        As they fought to keep their school alive
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the great sandstorm,
        Abydos high was known as the strongest.
        But after the tradegy, everything changed,
        And the students were left to pay the debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually the students left one by ome,
        Until only two were left under the sun.
        They faced the debt, the lose, the fight,
        Holding each other through the endless night.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even the strongest hearts can fade,
        And Yume's light began to shade.
        No final words, no last goodbye,
        Just silence underneath the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        With long ponytail pink hair and sleep eyes,
        She wears her shades beneath the skies.
        A coat uniform without a coat. a charm so still,
        Yet hides strenght and iron will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoshino was left with all the pain,
        The heavy storms, the endless rain.
        She laughed to hide the scars inside,
        And led alone, though part of her died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in her third and final year,
        She hides her doubts and swallows fear.
        With tired eyes, she stands ahead,
        to guide her juniors in Yume's Stead
      </p>
      <P>
        She tried to act like all was fine,
        A leader brave, a steady sign.
        But when her friend was pulled away,
        Her calm began to slip and sway.
      </P>
      <p>
        she snapped beneath the weight she bore,
        Her warmth replaced by something more.
        A storm awakened in her soul,
        That even she could not control.
      </p>
      <p>
        But hands reached out and pulled her near,
        The voices of her friends sincere.
        She faced her pain, stood up once more,
        The Hoshino her juniors swore.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stood where storms had once begun,
        No longer just a girl who'd run.
        With wounds still fresh, she chose to lead,
        A shield for those who still believe.
      </p>
